HONEYPOT PROJECT OVERVIEW
=========================

WHAT IS A HONEYPOT?
-------------------
A honeypot is a security mechanism that creates a decoy system or network designed to attract and detect attackers. It mimics vulnerable systems to lure malicious actors, allowing security professionals to observe attack patterns, techniques, and tools in a controlled environment.

Think of it as a trap - you set up something that looks vulnerable and valuable, then watch what attackers do when they find it.


WHY WE USE HONEYPOTS IN CYBERSECURITY
--------------------------------------
1. THREAT INTELLIGENCE
   - Observe real-world attack methods as they evolve
   - Identify emerging threats before they hit production systems
   - Collect malware samples for analysis
   - Understand attacker motivations and targets

2. EARLY WARNING SYSTEM
   - Detect reconnaissance and scanning activity
   - Alert on unauthorized access attempts
   - Identify new attack vectors before exploitation

3. RESEARCH AND LEARNING
   - Study attack techniques in safe, isolated environments
   - Build expertise in incident response
   - Understand how attackers think and operate

4. DISTRACTION AND DEFLECTION
   - Waste attacker time and resources on fake systems
   - Keep attackers away from production infrastructure
   - Provide false information to mislead adversaries
